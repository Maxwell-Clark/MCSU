      <strong>Mindfulness:</strong> A mental state of being fully present and aware of the current moment, without judgment. It involves observing thoughts, feelings, and sensations as they arise, often in everyday activities (e.g., eating, walking, or listening). It can be practiced informally throughout the day or as a formal exercise.

      <strong>Meditation:</strong> A structured practice where you set aside time to focus the mind, often to achieve calmness, clarity, or insight. It typically involves specific techniques (e.g., focusing on breath, a mantra, or visualization) and is often done in a seated, quiet setting.

      Handling distractions or a wandering mind during meditation is a common challenge, even for experienced practitioners. All minds wander â€“ it is natural and normal and really presents an opportunity for practice. Here are practical strategies to manage it:

    <List size="sm" spacing="md">
      <List.Item>
        <Text size="sm"><strong>Acknowledge Without Judgment:</strong> When your mind wanders, don't criticize yourself. Simply notice the distraction (e.g., a thought, sound, or sensation) and gently label it (e.g., "thinking" or "noise"). This builds awareness without frustration.</Text>
      </List.Item>
      <List.Item>
        <Text size="sm"><strong>Return to Your Anchor:</strong> Choose a focal point for your meditation, like your breath, a mantra, or a part of your body like the hands or feet. When you notice your mind drifting, calmly bring your attention back to this anchor.</Text>
      </List.Item>
      <List.Item>
        <Text size="sm"><strong>Reframe Distractions as Practice:</strong> View distractions as opportunities to strengthen your focus. Notice the thoughts as they arise, stay for a while and then pass away. After noticing the passing thoughts, just redirect your attention back to your anchor. Each time you redirect attention back to your anchor, you're training your mind, like exercising a muscle.</Text>

      The time needed to see meditation benefits varies based on individual goals, consistency, and practice type, but research and practical experience provide some guidance. An important note is that consistency may be more important than duration.

          <strong>Minimum Effective Duration:</strong> Studies suggest as little as 10-20 minutes per day can yield measurable benefits, such as reduced stress, improved focus, and better emotional regulation, within 4-8 weeks of consistent practice. For example, a 2018 study in Behavioural Brain Research found that 13 minutes of daily mindfulness meditation for 8 weeks improved attention and reduced anxiety in beginners.

          <strong>Beginner Recommendations:</strong> If you're new to meditation, start with 5-10 minutes daily. This is manageable and helps build a habit. Gradually increase to 15-20 minutes as you feel comfortable. Short, consistent sessions are more effective than infrequent, longer ones.
